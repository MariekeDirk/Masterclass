## What is R Markdown

* R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R
    * A mix text and R code together in one document
      * Knit the document = execute code and compile the document
    * A text file that can be tracked by git
    * User-friendly (compared to LaTeX) but still powerful
* Written in markdown, but can include HTML, LaTeX and R code

    * easy to learn with lots of support from RStudio
    * able to include LaTeX or HTML code
    * creates PDF and HTML output (and Word)
    * keep the tex file for journal submission

* this cats jumping skills
* issues with pandoc
